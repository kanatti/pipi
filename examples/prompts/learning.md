We're doing a guided walkthrough of a codebase or technical topic. Based on this conversation, generate a continuation prompt that includes:

- What areas have been covered so far (packages, concepts, files)
- What the user understands (confirmed through Q&A)
- Where notes are stored (if mentioned, e.g., ~/Documents/notes/)
- What's left to cover
- Next steps
- Methodology notes (e.g., Socratic approach, code-first vs concept-first)

Keep the format tight and readable. This will be used to resume the session later, so include enough context for both the user and the assistant to pick up where we left off.
