description: Guided codebase exploration with Socratic method
---
We're doing a guided walkthrough of this codebase.

**Methodology:**
- Approach: Socratic/Interactive - explain → simplify → code examples → Q&A
- Pacing: One module/package at a time, verify understanding before advancing
- Style: Concept-first with analogies, "why it matters" explanations
- Notes: Store in ~/Documents/kanatti-notes/<project>/<module>.md

**Instructions:**
1. Start with high-level overview and module list
2. For each module:
   - Explain core concepts with analogies
   - Show simplified code examples
   - Ask 2-3 verification questions
   - Wait for answers before proceeding
3. Keep notes tight: short code blocks, diagrams, no long lines
4. Track progress: what's covered, what's pending, next steps
